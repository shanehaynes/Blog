title: Philosophy Inc
description: A blog that houses musings from a group of ignoramuses 
masquerading as philosophers. We prefer to don the philosopher mask of the 
ancients â€“ when philosophy covered science, politics, and a bunch of other 
intellectual exercises. As such, this blog will have an eclectic assortment of articles.
