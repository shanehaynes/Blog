In _Descartes_ , Margaret Dauler Wilson spends time discussing how personal identity
might function under Descartes philosophical system.$^2$ Descartes says nothing about how
thinking things, which is all that humans are according to him, can identify as distinct from other
thinking things, and persistently identify themselves through time. Wilson’s solution to this
problem is that we can identify mental substances by psychological and phenomenological
expressions. In this essay, I will engage with Wilson’s position in the context of dramatic
psychological change – times in life when the things you think and the ways you think change –
while identity persists. The type of change I’m taking about is change that does not depend on
who you are and what you do. This kind of dramatic mental change is apparent, and a known
experience for most. Formative experiences, trauma, and learning can all lead to dramatic mental
change. A car accident that lacerates the frontal lobe can leave a person completely different in
every way; or, fighting a war can change the essence of how a person thinks. Wilson’s position
can somewhat account for this mental change, and has to because it is a common experience, but
ultimately, Wilson’s position is dysfunctional.
In this essay, I will present Wilson’s argument, and how Wilson might account for
dramatic mental change given her position. I will then show that her solution is insufficient, as it
cannot functionally account for the persistence of identity through mental change. I will then
provide a different solution to Descartes problem, derived from Descartes’ own account of how
we identify physical substances. The solution I propose rests on Descartes’ idea that we _just
know_ , with the mind alone, the persisting and distinct identity of an object. My solution functions

with dramatic mental change, and does not undermine Descartes’ metaphysics. Finally, I will
object and reply to my own argument against Wilson.
**I. I Wilson’s Argument**
In _Descartes_ , Wilson argues that personal identity is unaccounted for in Descartes
philosophical system.$^3$ In the Cogito argument, Descartes’ concludes that he is a thinking thing,$^4$
and Descartes will later conclude that he is _only_ a thinking thing, or, in other words, a mental
substance that thinks.$^5$ Descartes extends this claim, such that all beings with souls, or humans,
are _only_ thinking things. Wilson asks, if all people are thinking things, how then “is he
[Descartes] conceiving of himself as a particular entity, in distinction from other actual or
possible selves?”$^6$ Further, she asks on what grounds can the thinking thing be understood as a
persistent identity through time? People experience themselves as having a distinct and persistent
identity, and this is a common experience that is important to defend; distinct identity allows for
a personal mental life, and persistence allows for mental life to development and grow. An
adequate structure that establishes the experience of a distinct and persisting identity is missing
from Descartes’ metaphysics. On top of that, Descartes makes developing personal identity
harder by limiting what we can know about mental substances. As Wilson says “the possibility of
knowing oneself as a particular [self] seems ruled out by the doctrine that we apprehend only
general attributes like ‘thought’ and ‘extension.”$^7$ What Descartes requires is a set of identifiers

that is specific to the individual, so that the individual can be established amongst a sea of mental
substances. Wilson offers a solution.
Wilson argues that Descartes problem can be solved if individual mental substances, or
persons, are identified by their mental expressions. Wilson says
“Descartes would have to introduce a principle that would not be
easy to justify. He would have to hold that mental substances may
after all be identified and distinguished according to the
psychological or phenomenological features they exhibit... We are
different thinking things on the have) different and incompatible thoughts, memories, attitudes and grounds that we have (or think we
so forth.” $^8$
There is a lot to pull out here, but what I take Wilson to be saying is that the _kinds of things_ we
think and the _ways in which_ we think is what we can use to differentiate ourselves from others.
As Wilson says, _I_ am the only one (as far as _I_ am concerned) that experiences the thoughts,
attitudes, and beliefs that _I_ do. When I see other thinking things out in the world, I don’t attribute
my own psychological and phenomenological expressions to them. As a foil to this example, one
can imagine a mind reader who constantly hears the voices of others he sees on the street. It
would follow that he would lose the ability to distinguish _his_ thoughts from the thoughts of
others, and lose the distinct identity the rest of us non-telepaths enjoy. Thus, psychological and
phenomenological expressions, or mental expressions as I will call them, account for how we
distinguish ourselves from others, but how do they account for persisting identity?
Wilson thinks Memory can account for our persistence of identity, but it is unclear how
this would function. All Wilson says on memory, and persistence of identity, is that “my
memories _would_ after all be relevant to my belief that I have continued in existence for a while
as an identical self (as surely they are!)”$^9$ Wilson’s specific conception of memory is important,

$^8$ _Descartes,_ pages 19 9
$^9$ _Descartes_ , pages 199-200.


because it holds the entire weight of persistence of identity; however, it is unclear what Wilson
means by “memory” or why it would result in persistence – it is unclear what a person would be
remembering that would give rise to a persisting personal identity. I take Wilson to be saying our
memories of ourselves as ourselves upholds our identity through time. This is the only plausible
option for Wilson. Memories of other mental expressions cannot create persistence, as the mental
expressions would no longer apply to the person in scenarios of mental change. Thus, memory is
a mechanism that provides a representation of self that can be called forth at any point. My
identity persists because of my ability to access the representation of self at any moment, and
consistently through time.
There are a few things Wilson gets right, but certain things that need to be expanded on.
Firstly, I agree with Wilson’s picture of distinctness. I think it follows that a personal and private
mental experience results in a distinct identity. However, it is unclear how persistence works
under Wilson’s account. She mentions memory, yes, but what memory is, as an experience, how
certain memories are arrived at and called forth, or what happens in scenarios where a person
loses their memory but still experiences a sense of self remain largely unanswered. The picture
of memory I offer above is already an interpretation of what Wilson says. Wilson’s account of
personal identity needs to account for a persisting identity under the possibility of change. What
follows is a charitable view of how Wilson _might_ do this, and why her account fails.
**I. II. Wilson’s Position Fails During Change**
One way in which Wilson’s position can account for a persisting identity through
dramatic psychological change. Dramatic psychological change results in changes of the mental
expressions in which identity is instantiated according to Wilson. I think it’s important to engage
with Wilson’s argument on the grounds that it _can_ account for dramatic changes in mental


expression because Wilson is particularly concerned with persistence. Although not explicitly
mentioned, dramatic changes need to be a part of Wilson’s position, since major shifts in a
person’s mental expressions, while retaining personal identity, is a common experience. Wilson
has two options that can account for change in mental expressions while retaining personal
identity. Memory is Wilson’s first option, and the one she explicitly favors, but it is also the case
that people lose their memory and still know who they are; for example, retrograde amnesia. In
order to give a charitable view of Wilson’s position, I will also explore how persistence of
identity functions with and without using memory. I will ultimately show that neither option can
account for a persisting identity through change.
Wilson’s view can account for persistence of identity following dramatic mental change
by concentrating identity to specific traits. Under Wilson’s view, all the nuanced mental
expressions a person has collectively result in the experience of a distinct and persisting self.
When people undergo psychological change, it is rarely the case that _all_ a person’s memories,
habits of thought, and opinions will disappear at once. Following change in my mental
expressions, my identity does not reside in the new mental expressions I take on, because this
would be a _different_ set of mental expressions, and hence a different identity. Rather, identity
becomes concentrated in a mental expression that is left over from my past. Before change, _I_ was
a result of a thousand mental idiosyncrasies, but after a change of half those habits, _I_ am now a
result of the remaining half. Problems arise with such an arrangement when this decay reduces
personal identity to a single mental expression. Identity _must_ become concentrated in remaining
expression because the new expressions have no connection to the personal identity you know,
but your personal identity is a result of your mental expressions.


I argue that the identity concentration move – that identity must become concentrated in
leftover mental expressions following change – is dysfunctional. I will use the example of
theoretical person _Y_ to demonstrate how this move fails. Wilson mentions attitude as a specific
psychological and phenomenological expression by which a person can identify. I will use a
<hardworking>$^10$ attitude as a mental expression that persists through change, and describe the
resulting conundrum. What happens is that when identity becomes concentrated to a single
mental expression, referencing oneself becomes incredibly difficult; the self is no longer its own
concept, but is synonymous with the concept of the mental expression to which it has become
concentrated. _Y_ was once a hardworking lawyer, with a wife and two kids. He worked
relentlessly, day and night, and cared very much for his family. According to Wilson, he knows
he is himself because the sum of his mental expressions gives rise of a persistent and distinct
identity. When he was 32, he got into a serious car accident and lost his ability to practice as a
lawyer, and all his memory; however, he retained his personal identity. Because of the accident,
_Y_ could no longer provide for his family, and became seriously depressed. His wife left him, and
he is now an angry, spiteful, and lonely man. However, he is still very hard working. He washes
dishes now, which is all he can do following his accident, but washes dishes as hard as he
possibly can. In Wilsons picture, _Y_ has a persisting identity, and knows that _he_ has undergone
these changes, because his identity has become concentrated to his hardworking attitude. What
happens when _Y_ says “I am myself”? Is _Y_ refencing his own identity or the attitude
<hardworking>? Or, when speaking of a coworker, _Y_ says “he is very hardworking.” Does he
mean here that his coworker is himself? Or, if _Y_ were to say “I am going to be lazy today,” it
would result in a contradiction because _Y_ cannot _be_ hardworking and lazy at the same time. _Y_ ’s

$^10$ I will use the symbols “< _value_ >” to denote a specific^ mental expression. This is used for clarity, instead of saying
“the attitude _value_ .”


claims about himself are actually claims about <hardworking>, and attributing <hardworking> to
something would be to attribute his identity to that entity. If identity is instantiated by a single
mental expression, _Y_ cannot reference himself or <hardworking> separately, but this is
something we do. We claim things about ourselves and others, often attributing mental
expressions to others, and this requires the self and mental expressions to be different. Wilson’s
view may account for mental change with this concentration of identity move, however,
inadequately. In order for us to make the propositions of the type that we do, our self cannot _be_ a
mental expression; rather, the self requires a standalone concept, and this is not the case under
Wilson’s position. Wilson’s option to account for persistence of identity through change, by
concentrating identity to a mental expression, cannot function properly. However, in Wilson’s
view, memory may be the key to binding identity through dramatic changes in the psyche.
Memory is the other mental expression that might be able to account for persistence
through mental change. Memory functions differently than other mental expressions because one
does not need to realize a specific concept, but the representation of a concept. With other mental
expressions, I need to realize some trait or belief; but memory only requires the memory of a
self. Even if all your mental expressions change, you still have memories of yourself, and so
your _self_ persists. Let’s use _Y_ again as an example to demonstrate how relying on memory for
persistence of self is circular. _Y_ will be functioning under Wilson’s account of personal identity,
this time where every mental expression has changed, except for memory. Before his accident, _Y_
was himself, and this was a result of all his different mental expressions. After the accident and
the resulting loss, his mental expressions are all totally different – he thinks differently and
thinks different things – but he remains _Y_ because he remembers himself as _Y_ from before the
accident. _Y_ cannot be relying on the memory of the expressions that once made him himself


because these expressions no longer apply to him and cannot create a sense of identity; _Y_ cannot
use his memories as a way to know _where his identity comes from_. Rather, _Y_ is left with is the
memory of himself, unknowing to how that self came to be. Without an original source of self,
memory of self cannot provide the current sense of self, because there is no account of where the
self came from. In other words, claiming that memory of oneself as oneself can be the source of
identity is question-begging; the self necessarily relies on the self to know thyself. Memory fails
as a mechanism to uphold the persistence of identity.
Wilson’s argues that Descartes can answer the question of how mental substances can
have persisting and distinct identity by identifying with psychological and phenomenological
expressions. However, Wilson’s position cannot account for persisting identity through changes
in those mental expressions. This is because Wilson’s account requires identity to become
concentrated in a mental expression following change, or relies on memory of the self-concept as
a source of self. The former approach creates problems for self-reference, and the latter begs the
question. Neither a specific trait nor memory can uphold identity successfully. I propose a
different solution to the problem that uses what Descartes says about identity of physical
substances, and can fully account for persistence and distinctness of personal identity.
**II. A Descartes Style Solution**
Descartes famous wax argument describes how physical substances have persistent and
distinct identities although attributes of the body are changing.$^11$ If this method of identification
can be applied to mental substances, an account of personal identity that fits with Descartes
philosophical system can be developed, accounting for dramatic psychological change. The
scene Descartes sets is a piece of wax that melts as it sits before a hot flame. The shape, color,

$^11$ CSM II, Second Meditation, pages 20^ - 21.


and scent of the wax all change, yet he observes it as the same piece of wax. Descartes will argue
that this happens because he perceives the wax “by [his] mind alone.”$^12$ Descartes reaches this
point by first claiming that we understand things with with our imagination and senses, or with
the mind alone. When we understand objects, we are able to consistently identify them through
time. Further, the things we grasp with our senses or imagination are appearance-based attributes
of the object, and it is those appearance-based attributes that change in the case of the wax.
Therefore, when we understand the consistent identity of an object, we are not doing it through
our senses or imagination. However, for Descartes, in order to consistently identify objects, a
person needs to grasp some essential quality about the object; I need to know ‘ _what the object
is._ ’$^13$ Because we do not use the imagination or sensation to identify objects, we must do it with
the mind alone, as this is our only other option. Our pure intellect is responsible for our ability to
consistently identify objects through change.
There are important things to notice about the structure of the wax argument. This is an
argument about _identity_ of physical substances. Descartes argument still stands when there are
two pieces of wax, both with opposite shapes and colors (a blue cube and a red sphere), which
are then modified such that each piece of wax takes on the appearance of the other. In such a
scenario, pure intellect allows us to know one piece of wax from the other, and that it is the same
piece of wax throughout change. Such an example depicts a persistent and distinct identity.
Descartes’ wax argument is on the topic of physical substances, not mental, but if the jump can
be made, all the criteria of identity will be accounted for. To recognize a persistent and distinct
identity of an object, we need to know some essential thing about the object. The appearance of

$^12$ CSM II, Second Meditation, page 20.^
$^13$ I am grateful to Lije Millgram for this formation of Descartes’ wax argument through personal communication.
The phrase grasp ‘ _what the object is’_ comes directly from him.


the object cannot provide this essential thing (Descartes’ first claim), and this is where Descartes
second major claim lies – that we cannot use the systems which grasp appearances to identify
those objects (sense and imagination).
We use the mind alone to understand the essential thing that leads to a persistent and
distinct identity – _what the object is_ – but if the mind provides us with features of the object that
are unreliable, and did not depict _what the object is_ , it would be a dysfunctional way of
identifying objects, equal to the senses or the imagination. This is why Wilson’s position does
not follow from Descartes’ wax argument, even though we grasp mental expressions using the
mind. Mental expressions are unreliable in the way Descartes is concerned because, following
dramatic scenarios like trauma or formative experiences, mental expressions change regardless
of the mental substance realizing that change. If I change as a result of a traumatic experience,
the traumatic experience plays a role, just as we know the wax will melt when put next to a
flame, but this is not a function of _who we are_ or _what the [wax] is_. Change of mental substances
does not rely on a persistent and distinct identity, and therefore cannot be used to identify mental
substances, although understood with the mind and not the senses or imagination. The wax
argument needs to be applied to mental substances through a reliance on an essential and
unchanging quality of that substance, not a reliance on a specific mechanism of analysis. Once
Descartes’ theory of identity for physical substances is applied to mental substances, a theory of
identity is reached _through_ Descartes philosophical system, and stays true to his style and
metaphysics. Further, it can successfully account for persistence of identity through mental
change.
Just as we grasp the identity of the wax with the mind alone, so too do we grasp personal
identity with the mind alone, and this accounts for distinctness and persistence. To use an earlier


example, _Y_ knows that he is the one who has lost his job and family, because his pure intellect
allows him to grasp _who he is_. He has a persisting and distinct identity, that is not reached
through the mental expressions which belong to him, as Wilson thought, but rather understood
with the mind alone. This accounts for distinctness for the same reason we can differentiate two
pieces of wax with the same qualities from each other; we just _know_ they are different. Further,
this accounts for persistence through mental change in the same way the wax persists through
physical change. We _just know_ one piece of wax as that piece of wax. For personal identity, we
still know we are ourselves, no matter what changes our mental expressions might go through,
because those mental expressions do not determine identity or allow us to understand it. When
applying Descartes’ wax argument to mental substances, mental expressions, of the type Wilson
champions, are like the appearance attributes of the wax. These attributes or mental expressions
can change however they like, but they will not deter an observer from knowing that the same
piece of wax or personal identity remains.
This answer seems unsatisfying, but it functions better than Wilson’s position, and
operates under Descartes’ metaphysics. As displayed in section 1 of this paper, Wilson cannot
account for a persistent and distinct identity because dramatic mental change is a common
experience, and Wilsons position does not function following dramatic mental change. Descartes
position _can_ account for change because _who we are_ is undisturbed by the mental change taking
place. It is common place to say something like “I’m a different person now,” but this seems to
be hyperbole to demonstrate growth, rather than a metaphysical statement about personal
identity. If I did become a different person, the things that happened in the past would have no
effect on me, because they would be someone else’s memories implanted into my head. Claiming
that pure intellect enables us to have a persistent and distinct identity operates under Descartes


metaphysical proposition that all we are all thinking things. Even if we are only thinking things,
we can still understand _who we are_ with pure intellect. This account of personal identity is a
derivative of Descartes’ philosophy and aligns with his metaphysics.
A question remains about one of Wilsons concerns - that all we can apprehend about
mental substance is a general attribute of “thinking.” If this is the case, then how could we
account for identity of a mental substance that is not connected to mental expressions? Wilson
seems to be under the impression that identity can only arise from an attribute that is specific to
the substance being discussed. This is why “knowing oneself as a particular” is impossible if we
cannot know specific attributes of a substance. I think this is a very limited scope of how identity
is applied to substance. It can be the case, as with the wax, that identity is perceived through the
mind alone as something we see clearly and distinctly, and not a summation of specific traits, or
a trait itself. Descartes position is that a physical substance is “merely something extended,
flexible, and changeable” and yet, “the perception I have of it is a case of ... purely mental
scrutiny.”^$14$ So, although I cannot know specific attributes of a substance, I can still decern
identity.
**III. I Objection to impossibility of single-trait identity**
In the first section of this paper, I argued that Wilson cannot sufficiently account for
persistence of identity through dramatic mental change. In this section, I argue that Wilson
cannot uphold distinctness of identity either, following dramatic mental change. This also
provides more support for why the Descartes-style solution is required; both criteria –
persistence and distinctness – fail under Wilson’s view, so an alternative is desperately needed. I
frame this through an objection Wilson might have to my objection of her, claiming that plenty

$^14$ CSM II, Second Meditation, pages 20^ - 21.


of people derive their identity from single traits, and this is a fully functional way to live. I
answer by demonstrating that this objection takes identity and personal identity (in the
metaphysical sense) to be the same thing, when in fact they are not.
Some people derive their entire identity from a single trait, and lead fully functional lives,
so the self-reference problems discussed in section 1 do not really happen. There is a culturally
popular example of the obsessed artist who lives for art, and their entire identity, there whole
self, is upheld in a single action or trait. A person like this breaks down my objection to Wilson,
as the artist is fully function and derives their personal identity from a single concept. The artist
does not experience any self-reference conundrums or mix ups between his own identity and
other artists. The fact that this person exists and is functional means that a premise from section
I. II. – that when identity is held in a single trait self-reference is problematic – is wrong.
Because that premise is wrong, Wilson’s argument can account for mental change when it is
concentrated into a single mental expression.
I respond to this by saying that sense of self does not come from the thing a person
identifies with. The artist objection assumes that what a person identifies with and personal
identity, the sense of self that is distinct and persistent, are synonymous; however, they are
different. Distinctness and persistence, which fall under the term “personal identity” in this
paper, can be thought of as a _sense of self_.^$15$ This is different than the _identity_ , which is an
aesthetics of self – traits and activities we associate our sense of self with. If the obsessed artist
derived their sense of self from the trait <being an artist>, distinctness would not be possible.
This is because there is more than one obsessed artist in existence. If every obsessed artist
derives their sense of self from <being an artist>, then it is unclear where one artist ends and the

$^15$ ‘Sense of self’ and ‘personal identity^ ’ mean the same thing in this essay. I switch from personal identity to sense
of self in this section because it makes things less confusing.


next begins. But this is not the case. Each individual artists experiences a distinct identity.
Because several obsessed artists are living in the world at once, and not mixing together their
personal identities, the obsessed artist objection must be talking about identity, and not sense of
self. Identity in this sense – what you associate your experience as a distinct and persistent self
with – does not play a role in my analysis. The obsessed artist objection conflates sense of self,
also called personal identity in this essay, with identity. Wilson’s position cannot support
distinctness of identity because if personal identity was derived from a single trait, which results
ins scenarios of change following Wilson’s reasoning, then several people who derived their
identity from the same trait would think themselves to be a single person. The Descartes’ style
solution I propose can account for persistence and distinctness, making it a better option than
Wilson’s proposed solution.
**Conclusion**
Wilson’s position claims that personal identity can be derived from psychological and
phenomenological expressions; however, scenarios of dramatic changes in those expressions
results in identity being concentrated onto single traits, or a heavy reliance on memory. Wilson
cannot account for persistence, because if such a concentrated source of identity did exist, it
would not function for problems of self-reference. Further, reliance on memory of self as a
source of personal identity is circular. The Descartes style solution I propose does not have any
of these problems, since personal identity is derived from pure intellect, and is derived from
Descartes’ own philosophical system.
While I am satisfied with the Descartes-style account I have given, there are many
questions that still remain. What got me interested in personal identity in the first place was
questions about people struggling with identity crisis. It seem that the solution I propose would


do very little for a struggling individual. ‘You are who you know you are’ is probably incredibly
unsatisfying for an individual going through an identity crisis. Further, there are questions about
memory as a specific phenomenological process might change Wilson’s analysis. Through
discussion with a friend on this paper,$^16$ I realized that the only times when you are likely to
remember your sense of self would be in times of doubt. This is because memories seem to be
called forth for a specific purpose, and what purpose does remembering your identity serve, other
than reliving doubt? If this is the case, Wilson’s position seems to mesh more smoothly with
people facing an identity crisis; however, the main focus of the current paper was to be
Descartes, and it seems like a stretch to interpret Wilson’s conception of memory from the short
passage I engage with. I also wonder what role social context plays in the conception of the self.
To take _Y_ as an example again, the sentiment of a hardworking attitude seems to be deeply
connected to his class position, as a lawyer, and role as a provider.$^17$ Perhaps the reason that his
hardworking attitude persists through all of the mental changes is because _Y_ is holding onto an
image of himself as an upper-class individual. In such a case, belief of a hardworking attitude
seems more important than the instantiation of the attitude itself. These are only questions, and
require much more time to be answered effectively. I look forward to continuing to work on this
topic, and hope to provide a sufficient merger between social views of identity and Descartes
metaphysics in the future.
